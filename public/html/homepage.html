      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am Sebastian Alvis, a 24-year-old coding enthusiast, cat lover, and dungeon master. I earned a Bachelor's in Engineering Physics at UIUC and a Master's Degree in Physics at UW, then went on to complete a 6-month, 500-hour data science bootcamp from <a href="https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science-career-track/">SpringBoard</a>. Now, I am looking to start my data science career. I like knowing how things work together, and being able to own the data science process end-to-end.</p>

    <div class="row" id="coding_exp">
      <h4>Code Used in the Data Science Bootcamp</h4>
      <p>The bootcamp refined my Python and SQL skills, and taught me various Python packages for use in data science and machine learning, such as Pandas, scikit-learn, keras, and more. Most of the work I submitted for grading was through GitHub, and the two capstone projects I did were in Jupyter Notebooks.</p>
      <p>The two capstone projects I did are available on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/salvis2/SpringboardAlvis">here</a>.</p>
      <p>The first project is an analysis of game data from League of Legends. I act as if I am an analyst for Riot Games, the studio that makes this game, trying to help keep the game balanced. At the end of the project, I make 8 strong balance recommendations that I found from my statistical and machine learning analyses. I gave this <a href="https://github.com/PuPPy-Python/Scientific_Computing/blob/master/talk_materials/SebastianAlvis_slides_25Apr19.pdf">final presentation</a> about this work at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/PSPPython">PuPPy</a> Scientific Computing meeting on April 25th, 2019. More information is available in this <a href="https://github.com/salvis2/SpringboardAlvis/tree/master/capstone_project_1">repository</a>.</p>
      <p>The second project is an analysis of Twitter data about the game studio, Bungie, and their hit game, Destiny 2. In this, I act as an analyst trying to glean any information I can on the public's opinion of the studio and the game. I analyze the habits of those on Twitter and find the factors that make tweets popular, as well as discovering that positive sentiment tweets get more engagement than negative ones. This shows that the general audience of Destiny 2 thinks well of the studio and game. More information about this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/salvis2/SpringboardAlvis/tree/master/capstone_project_2">here</a>.</p>

      <h4>Code Used in Research</h4>
      <p>The majority of my year and a half in the Majorana group has been spent learning <a href="https://root.cern.ch/">ROOT</a>. This toolkit can be mounted onto Python and C++, both of which I used to run ROOT scripts (with the help of some CSH) on the PDSF supercomputer at UC Berkeley.</p>
      <p>Within Python, I used the numpy and matplotlib modules, and also created my own modules for reusability and the ease of merging existing code into a single script.</p>
      <p>The only non-ROOT libraries in C++ that I used was the STL, for the map and vector data structures.</p>

      <h2>Coding Experience</h2>
      <p>My coding experience spans classwork at two world-class institutions, complex nuclear physics research, this website, and the data science bootcamp.</p>

      <h4>Classwork at the University of Washington</h4>
      <p>In the fall of 2017, I took CSE 344: Introduction to Database Management. This class taught me the various database querying languages (SQL, noSQL, SQL++), several types of databases (relational, JSON), some database technologies (Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite), some cloud technologies (AWS), and other database concepts (indexes, transactions).</p>

      <h4>Code Used to Build This Website</h4>
      <p>This website presently uses HTML and CSS for the basics, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> for the grid, which enables easier alignment of elements on this page, Javascript for the navbars, jQuery, and React for the Character Creator. The Character Creator is built with Babel, Webpack, and several of my own modules in a Node.js environment. Since upgrading the server, I have been preparing to use some back-end technologies. There is now a Node.js / Express skeleton to help serve the existing files as static on the new web server.</p>

      <h2>Research Experience</h2>
      <p>Experimental physics research is heavily multidisciplinary. My year and a half with the <a href="https://www.npl.washington.edu/majorana/majorana-experiment">Majorana</a> experiment involved engineering, programming, and data science.</p>

      <h4>Engineering</h4>
      <p>There is a germanium detector at UW of the same style that the Majorana experiment uses. In working to bring this detector to working capacity, I used Autodesk Inventor to design, install, and test three-dimensional parts. I have maintained this detector’s assembly, repaired the turbopump it uses, and began redesigning it to incorporate suggested changes from a report on a variable-position alpha-source scanner.</p>

      <h4 id="ROOT">Programming</h4>
      <p>The primary software framework used in experimental physics is <a href="https://root.cern.ch/">ROOT</a>. ROOT features unique data structures, improves parallelization on processing, scanning, and moving large amounts of data, and has tools to visualize and analyze data. I learned ROOT mostly by myself and with some help from those in my research group, and used it to learn Majorana’s data and the analysis tasks I performed. I mounted ROOT onto Python and C++ and built modules and scripts to parallelize my data processing and to perfect my data-quality-checking workflow.</p>
      
      <p>I gave a <a href="https://github.com/PuPPy-Python/Scientific_Computing/blob/master/talk_materials/SebastianAlvis_16Aug18.pdf">talk</a> about this work at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/PSPPython">PuPPy</a> Scientific Computing meeting on Aug 16th, 2018.</p>

      <h4>Data Science</h4>
      <p>My initial analysis consisted of tracking a parameter across detectors and time, finding areas where it was unstable, and fixing them using existing scripts, which required occasional debugging and modification. Later analyses performed an instability quantification, calculating the parameter shift that encapsulated a few percent of the data. This was used as a benchmark to validate instability levels.</p>

      <h2>Dungeons and Dragons Applications</h2>
      <p>In order to gain experience with web development, I needed a personal project to motivate myself to get the work done. For me, Dungeons and Dragons has long been an enjoyable game that brings family and friends together, and has recently been a huge creative outlet (writing characters, backstories, campaigns). Written in ReactJS.</p> 
      <p>These applications are mostly tailored to Dungeon Masters, including roll simulations to speed up NPC / monster combat, and random ability score / hit point dice rollers. Both DMs and players can make good use of the character sheet generator.</p>
