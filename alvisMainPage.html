      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am Sebastian Alvis, a 24-year-old once-aspiring physicist, coding enthusiast, cat lover, and dungeon master. I have completed my second year of the Physics PhD program at UW, complete with Master’s Degree, and am now looking for internship experience to ease my way into an entry-level Software Developer position.</p>

    <div class="row" id="research_exp">
      <h2>Research Experience</h2>
      <p>Experimental physics research is heavily multidisciplinary. My year and a half with the Majorana experiment involved engineering, programming, and data science.</p>

      <h3>Engineering</h3>
      <p>There is a germanium detector at UW of the same style that the Majorana experiment uses. In working to bring this detector to working capacity, I used Autodesk Inventor to design, install, and test three-dimensional parts. I have maintained this detector’s assembly, repaired the turbopump it uses, and am currently redesigning it to incorporate suggested changes from a report on a variable alpha-source scanner.</p>

      <h3 id="ROOT">Programming</h3>
      <p>The primary software package used in all of physics is ROOT, which creates unique data structures, improves parallelization on large amounts of data, and has tools to visualize and analyze data. I learned ROOT through teaching myself, and used it to learn Majorana’s data and the analysis tasks I performed. I mounted ROOT onto Python and C++ and build modules and scripts to parallelize my data processing and perfect my data-quality-checking workflow.</p>

      <h3>Data Science</h3>
      <p>My initial analysis consisted of tracking a parameter across detectors and time, finding areas where it was unstable, and fixing them using existing scripts, which required occasional debugging and modification. Later analyses performed an instability quantification, calculating the parameter shift that encapsulated a few percent of the data. This was used as a benchmark to validate instability levels.</p>

      <h3>Classwork at the University of Washington</h3>
      <p>Last fall, I took CSE 344: Introduction to Database Management. This class taught me the various database querying languages (SQL, noSQL, SQL++), several types of databases (relational, JSON), some database technologies (Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite), some cloud technologies (AWS), and other database concepts (transactions).</p>

      <h3>Code Used in Research</h3>
      <p>The majority of my year and a half in the Majorana group has been spent learning <a href="#ROOT">ROOT</a>. This tooklit can be mounted onto Python and C++, both of which I used to run ROOT scripts (with the help of some CSH) on the PDSF supercomputer at UC Berkeley.</p>
      <p>Within Python, I used the numpy and matplotlib modules, and also created my own modules for reusability and the ease of merging existing code into a single script.</p>
      <p>The only non-ROOT libraries in C++ that I used was the STL, for the map and vector data structures.</p>

      <h3>Code Used to Build This Website</h3>
      <p>This website presently uses HTML and CSS for the basics, and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> for the grid, which enables easier control of elements on this page.</p>

    <div class="row" id="dnd_apps">
      <p>In order to gain experience with web development, I needed a personal project to motivate myself to get the work done. Dungeons and Dragons has long been an enjoyable game that brings family and friends together for me, and has recently been a huge creative outlet (writing characters, backstories, campaigns). Written in Javascript, and hopefully soon, Jquery, Angular, and ReactJS.</p>
      <p>These applications are mostly tailored to Dungeon Masters, including roll simulations to speed up NPC / monster combat, and random ability score / hit point dice rollers. Both DMs and players can make good use of the character sheet generator, and speed comparison tools.</p>
