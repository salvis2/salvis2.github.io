Included right now are HTML and CSS to format and display the website body, JavaScript files to enable the dropdown bars, scroll correction, and dice rollers, the source and resultant files for the Character Creator, and an Express skeleton to serve the existing static files. 
Not included is the Nginx web server configuration.
